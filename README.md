# A mental calculation game for children

At first, the program will ask the child to choose the number of calculations he wants to do and the level of difficulty for the proposed calculations:
* Easy: Mixture of additions and subtractions between two numbers between 0 and 100. The subtractions are all positive
* Medium: Mixture of additions, subtractions, and multiplications between three numbers between 0 and 100. Except for multiplication, it is between a number between 0 and 100 and a number between 0 and 10
* Hard: Mixture of additions, subtractions, multiplications with a compulsory integer division

Then, a series of calculations will be proposed, and in the end, a note and appreciation will be given to the child.
